# FastAPI RAG Chat Service - Implementation Checklist

## 🔴 Critical Issues (Fix First)
- [ ] **Fix main.py duplication** - Remove duplicate FastAPI app definitions and consolidate
- [ ] **Complete AI service implementation** - Replace Google embeddings and LangChain stubs with real implementations
- [ ] **Create tests directory** - Missing test suite completely
- [ ] **Add security logging** - Implement required warnings for hard-coded password

## 🟡 Core Functionality
- [ ] **Complete AI service embeddings** - Real Google API integration using GOOGLE_API_KEY
- [ ] **Complete LangChain integration** - Google Generative AI connector for chat responses
- [ ] **Enhance Qdrant service** - Proper async methods, error handling, collection management
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling** - Validation and error responses for all endpoints
- [ ] **Review/update requirements.txt** - Ensure all dependencies are included

## 🟢 Testing & Quality
- [ ] **Implement chat API tests** - pytest tests for /chat/send and /chat/bubble with mocked services
- [ ] **Implement admin API tests** - pytest tests for admin endpoints with password verification
- [ ] **Implement service tests** - pytest tests for AI and Qdrant services with proper mocking
- [ ] **Test integration** - End-to-end testing of complete application

## 🔵 Polish & Documentation
- [ ] **Enhance admin UI** - Better styling and functionality for admin interface
- [ ] **Enhance chat bubble** - Better UX and functionality for chat widget
- [ ] **Update README.md** - Comprehensive setup instructions and security warnings

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Project structure: Complete and matches requirements
- ✅ Core files: Present with basic implementations
- ✅ Configuration: Hard-coded password and basic settings implemented
- ✅ Schemas/Models: Pydantic models defined
- ✅ Chat bubble template: Basic HTML/JS structure exists
- ⚠️ AI Integration: Placeholder implementations only
- ❌ Tests: Completely missing
- ⚠️ Error handling: Basic implementation

## 🎯 Priority Order
1. Fix main.py duplication
2. Complete AI service (Google APIs + LangChain)
3. Create test suite
4. Add security logging
5. Enhance error handling
6. Polish UI and documentation

## 🔐 Security Requirements
- Hard-coded admin password must remain (as per spec)
- Security warning must be logged at startup
- README must contain prominent security warning
- Password verification required for admin endpoints

## 📋 Implementation Notes
- All external services must be properly mocked in tests
- Chat bubble must be easily embeddable (HTML snippet)
- Admin UI should work without additional dependencies
- Follow modular architecture: API → Services → Core/DB
